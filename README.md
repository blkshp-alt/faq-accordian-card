## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript


### Continued development

I need to continue strengthening my skills in all areas of frontend development, but I hope to gain a better understanding of javascript.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1 position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) - This helped me understand the parent element needs to be relative and that the child element needs to be absolute to attain the positioning in the mock-up.

- [Example resource 2 translate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/translateX) - This is a great breakdown of how to move horizontally which is very important for this project.

The image placement for this challenge was tricky for me and required a lot of trial and error. I found YouTube and mdn extremely helpful.
